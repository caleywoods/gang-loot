# Gang Loot
This extension improves the search functionality for the Thatsmybis.com roster page when the user
has "Hide received" selected as an option as well as puts their Suicide Kings (SK) list position next to their name.

The normal behavior of the site when you do a search for a piece of loot is to return all raiders who have that piece of loot on their loot list regardless of whether or not they have recieved that piece of loot.

This behavior adds an extra step for The Gang because we use SK loot priority list and don't rely on the prioritization raiders give to items on Thatsmybis. You must first search for the item, then determine who actually still needs the item, and then compare the positions of each raider on the SK list to determine who to give the loot to.
